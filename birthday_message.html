  <h1>Happy Birthday Emaannn!</h1>
  <h2>Well, sorry not sorry for the twenty two clicks but its  your 22nd Freakin Birthday Brooo. You're getting Old, like literally O.L.D But koi ni, let's just stay young forever. 
Sara saal poochti hun nai and here I am hitting you up on Birthdays like this, sharam toh aati hai nai mje lekin chalo ab a hi gai hun toh happy birthday yaar.</h2>
<h2>I'll keep it short and just tell you this one thing on this special day that you really REALLLYYY mean ALOOTTTT to MEEE, incase you have any doubts. I dont think you can actually ever know how important you are to me and yes I will be repeating this sameee stuff every birthday coz I want you to always remember it. You will always ALWAYS have me rooting for you and will find me there for you when you need me or incase you just need an ear to listen to you just blabbering and yapping about yourself and all the insignificant little details of your life but haan don't expect me to reciprocate the same, I just really love hearing you talk about anything and everything and especially about your opinion on random things. 
I'll probably end it here with a cringe cliche I LOVE YOU ü§ç And I hope you have a great birthday and enjoy your day to the fullest.</h2>
